## Data-Exploration-and-Insights
During data cleaning, the following changes were made:
- Standardizing Date formats
```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE pixar_films
SET Release_date = STR_TO_DATE(Release_date, "%m/%d/%YYYY");

ALTER TABLE pixar_films
MODIFY COLUMN Release_date DATE;
```
- checking for duplicates
```sql
SELECT film, role_type, name, COUNT(*) AS count FROM pixar_people    
GROUP BY film, role_type, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Duplicate values present!
```
- Insert into a new table Pixar_people records that contains no duplicate
```sql
CREATE TABLE cleaned_pixar_people AS SELECT DISTINCT * FROM pixar_people;
```
- Exports as an external file and the re-imported back to the workbench
```
SELECT * FROM cleaned_pixar_people;
```

## Data-Insights

For each of the key business questions, SQL queries were used to extract meaningful insights:

### Financial Analysis
a. Identified the top 5 highest-grossing films with 'Inside Out 2' being the highest.

   - 8 films were a 'Hit'
   - 2 films were 'Break even'
   - 5 films were a 'flop'

     
c. No Significant correlation btwn Budget and box office. Correlation coefficient is about 0.2 


d. ROI analysis revealed the most profitable films... 'Toy story' has the highest with 1214.79% Return on investment

### Audience & Critical Reception
a. A weak positive correlatin between Critics(IMDB, Rotten tomatoes, Metacritics) and box office revenue


b. Distribution of films by CinemaScore rating
  - A ~ 15
  - A+ ~ 7
  - A- ~ 3
  - NA ~ 3
