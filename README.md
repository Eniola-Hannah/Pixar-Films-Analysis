UPDATE pixar_films
SET Release_date = STR_TO_DATE(Release_date, "%m/%d/%YYYY");

ALTER TABLE pixar_films
MODIFY COLUMN Release_date DATE;
```
- checking for duplicates
```sql
SELECT film, role_type, name, COUNT(*) AS count FROM pixar_people    
GROUP BY film, role_type, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Duplicate values present!
```
- Insert into a new table Pixar_people records that contains no duplicate
```sql
CREATE TABLE cleaned_pixar_people AS SELECT DISTINCT * FROM pixar_people;
```
- Exports as an external file and the re-imported back to the workbench
```
SELECT * FROM cleaned_pixar_people;
```
---


## Data-Exploration-and-Insights

For each of the key business questions, SQL queries were used to extract meaningful insights:

### 1. Financial Analysis
#### a. Top 5 Highest-Grossing Pixar Films

The top five highest-grossing Pixar films based on worldwide box office revenue are:
- Inside Out 2 – $1,698,030,965
- Incredibles 2 – $1,242,805,359
- Toy Story 4 – $1,073,394,593
- Toy Story 3 – $1,066,969,703
- Finding Dory – $1,028,570,889



#### b. Financial Performance of Pixar Films

Over the years, Pixar films have performed remarkably well at the box office:
   - 17 films generated high profits
   - 7 films yielded lower profits
   - 4 films resulted in losses


There are some terms in the film industry used to define the relationship between budget and box office earning, they include;
   - flop: A movie that fails financially.
   - Break-even: Covered costs but no profit whatsoever
   - Hit: Profitable, made good returns
   - Blockbuster: A massive success, major profits


Among Pixar films:
   - 22 films were classified as Blockbusters
   - 2 films were classified as Hits
   - 3 films were classified as Flops


     
#### c. Budget vs. Box Office Earnings Correlation

There is a weak positive correlation between a film’s budget and its box office earnings in different regions:
   - US/Canada Region – Correlation coefficient: 0.1999
   - International Region – Correlation coefficient: 0.3389


Correlation values between 0.1 and 0.3 indicate a weak positive correlation, meaning budget alone does not significantly influence box office earnings. Other factors, such as film stars, marketing/publicity, and regional audience preferences, may play a more significant role in a film’s success.



#### d. Top Films by ROI (Return on Investment)

ROI measures a film’s profitability relative to its budget. The top 5 most profitable Pixar films, ranked by ROI, are:
   - Toy Story – 1214.79%
   - Finding Nemo – 826.61%
   - Inside Out 2 – 749.02%
   - The Incredibles – 586.35%
   - Incredibles 2 – 521.40%


ROI Comparison Across Decades
A decade-wise comparison shows that the 1990s had the highest average ROI, indicating the most profitable era for Pixar films:
   - 1990s – 428.77% 
   - 2000s – 372.28%
   - 2010s – 314.51%
   - 2020s – 146.05%


This trend suggests that earlier Pixar films had higher profitability relative to their budgets, while more recent productions, despite high earnings, may have faced increased production and marketing costs, affecting ROI.



### 2. Audience & Critical Reception
#### a. Correlation Between Critics’ Ratings and Box Office Revenue

There is a weak positive correlation between a film’s ratings from critics and its box office earnings:
   - IMDB vs. Box Office – Correlation coefficient: 0.2962
   - Rotten Tomatoes vs. Box Office – Correlation coefficient: 0.2294
   - Metacritic vs. Box Office – Correlation coefficient: 0.2152


Since correlation values between 0.1 and 0.3 indicate a weak positive relationship, this suggests that critics' ratings (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic) do not significantly impact box office revenue.

However, CinemaScore appears to have a stronger impact on box office earnings than critics' ratings, making it a more reliable indicator of a film’s financial success.



#### b. Distribution of Films by CinemaScore Rating

CinemaScore ratings reflect audience satisfaction based on surveys conducted at movie theaters. Here’s how Pixar films are distributed based on their CinemaScore ratings:   - Films with ‘A’ CinemaScore rating: 15
   - Films with ‘A+’ CinemaScore rating: 7
   - Films with ‘A-’ CinemaScore rating: 3
   - Films with ‘NA’ (Not Available) CinemaScore rating: 3


This distribution highlights that the majority of Pixar films receive high audience approval, with most earning ‘A’ or ‘A+’ ratings, reinforcing their strong connection with viewers.


A further analysis was made of average worldwide box office earnings per CinemaScore rating which shows that films with an A+ rating generate the highest average revenue, suggesting that a CinemaScore of A+ positively impacts a film’s financial success.
   - A+	: 762162029.86
   - A	: 705627954.13
   - A-	: 309405952.67
   - NA	: 71858621.50



This reinforces the idea that audience sentiment at cinemas (CinemaScore) is a stronger predictor of box office success than critics' reviews.



#### c. Trend in Audience Ratings Over the Years

An analysis of audience ratings over time reveals that there has been no consistent improvement or decline. The number of films with improved ratings is equal to those with declined ratings, indicating a fluctuating trend rather than a clear upward or downward movement.
   - First Rating: 1 (Initial baseline)
   - Declined Rating: 13
   - Improved Rating: 13
   - No Change: 1


This suggests that audience perception of Pixar films has remained relatively stable over time, with both positive and negative shifts occurring in equal measure.



### 3. Awards and Recognition
#### a. Top Pixar Films with Awards and Nominations

The following Pixar films have received the most academy awards and nominations, making them the most critically recognized in the studio’s history:
   - Monsters, Inc.
   - Finding Nemo
   - The Incredibles
   - Ratatouille
   - WALL-E
   - Up

#### b. The Impact of Winning an Oscar on Box Office Success

Winning an Oscar appears to have a significant impact on a film’s financial success. To analyze this, a new column was added to the Academy Awards table to classify films as Oscar winners or non-winners:
```sql
ALTER TABLE academy
ADD COLUMN Oscar TEXT;

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE academy
SET Oscar = CASE WHEN status in ("Won", "Won Special Achievement")
                 THEN "Oscar_winners" ELSE "Non_Oscar_winners"
            END;
```
With this new classification, further analysis was conducted to compare box office earnings on an average between Oscar-winning and non-winning films. The results indicate that Oscar-winning films tend to generate higher box office revenue, confirming the award’s influence on a film’s financial performance.

| **Oscar Status**       | **Avg. US/Canada Revenue** | **Avg. International Revenue** | **Avg. Worldwide Revenue** |
|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Oscar Winners**      | $257,697,958.94          | $417,266,685.56              | $674,964,644.50            |
| **Non-Oscar Winners**  | $257,653,942.30          | $365,363,477.49              | $623,017,419.80            |

### 4. Genre Trends  
#### a. Most Common Genres Among Pixar Films  

The most frequent genres in Pixar films are:  
- **Adventure**  - 28 films  
- **Animation**  - 28 films  
- **Comedy**  - 21 films  

Adventure and Animation are the dominant genres, followed closely by Comedy.  



#### b. Average Runtime of Pixar Films Over the Decades  

The average runtime of Pixar films over different periods:  
- **1990 - 1999** : 89.33 minutes  
- **2000 - 2009** : 104.00 minutes  
- **2010 - 2019** : 101.45 minutes  
- **2020 - Present** : 99.86 minutes  

It is safe to say that longer runtimes generally correlate with higher box office performance.  

| **Period**         | **Avg. Runtime (min)** | **Avg. Box Office Revenue** |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **2010 - 2019**  | 101.45             | $785,684,220.64             |
| **2000 - 2009**  | 104.00             | $624,764,356.57             |
| **2020 - Present** | 99.86              | $451,092,996.33             |
| **1990 - 1999**  | 89.33              | $423,017,907.00             |

This trend suggests that films with a **longer runtimes (2000 - 2019** tend to generate higher box office revenue.  



#### c. Critics' & Audience Scores by Genre  

All Pixar film genres receive positive critical reviews, but **Family** and **Drama** tend to have the highest critic and audience scores.  

| **Genre**  | **Avg. Critic Score**  | **Avg. Audience Score**  |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Family**  | 95.0               | 8.4               |
| **Drama**   | 81.0               | 8.4               |

These findings suggest that **family-oriented and dramatic Pixar films resonate more strongly** with both critics and audiences.  



### 5. Creative Team Contributions
#### a. Most Frequent Directors and Writers  
Pixar has a diverse pool of creators, but the most frequent contributors are:  
- **John Lasseter** (Director) – 5 films  
- **Andrew Stanton** (Screenwriter) – 8 films  
- **Andrew Stanton** (Storywriter) – 8 films  

    
#### b. Correlation Between Specific Creators and Film Success  
An analysis was conducted to determine if specific creators consistently influenced a film’s success. The findings showed **no significant correlation** between creators and box office revenue or critical reception.  
This suggests that **Pixar's success may be driven by other factors rather than some specific creators.**
