## Data-Exploration-and-Insights
During data cleaning, the following changes were made:
- Standardizing Date formats
```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE pixar_films
SET Release_date = STR_TO_DATE(Release_date, "%m/%d/%YYYY");

ALTER TABLE pixar_films
MODIFY COLUMN Release_date DATE;
```
- checking for duplicates
```sql
SELECT film, role_type, name, COUNT(*) AS count FROM pixar_people    
GROUP BY film, role_type, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Duplicate values present!
```
- Insert into a new table Pixar_people records that contains no duplicate
```sql
CREATE TABLE cleaned_pixar_people AS SELECT DISTINCT * FROM pixar_people;
```
- Exports as an external file and the re-imported back to the workbench
```
SELECT * FROM cleaned_pixar_people;
```
